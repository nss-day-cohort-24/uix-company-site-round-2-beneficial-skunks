          <h1> How to write an awesome Startup About Us </h1>
              <p>
                    Did you know that the About Us page is the second most visited page on most websites? The Home page is no. 1. The content of your About Us page is really important in helping to build your credibility. People do business with those they know, like and trust. If a prospective buyer is looking for your product or service, and they land on your site, most often they want to know something about you and learn why they should trust you before they click the BUY icon.

                    Your startup About Us page should tell your story and build a relationship with your audience, but it must be written with the reader in mind. Most business owners are great at what they do, but it can be quite challenging to be able to look at the business from an outsider’s perspective. I like to tell my clients that the About Us page isn’t just about them, it’s about the partnership between them and their customers and what the business can offer the customer.
             </p> <br>
               <p>
                    Writing a startup About Us page can be a little challenging and some people find themselves wondering where to start. Take out a note pad or open a blank document on your computer and start noting down points you may want to make. Think about your reader – What they will want to know about your business?

                    Consider telling people you’re new. Being new isn’t necessarily a disadvantage – it can be fresh and exciting. A lot of people are happy to deal with a small home-based business or a startup, as long as you prove you are a credible option.
                    
                    One good thing about being a startup is, you can’t write a dull and boring company history as your About Us page! Nobody really wants to read those company history documents unless there’s information in there that is directly relevant to them. Try writing your About Us page as more of a story than a chronological list. This will make the page more interesting for your reader and therefore more likely to engage them, make them want to find out more about your company and then do business with you.
